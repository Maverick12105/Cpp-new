/*
Create a class Weight that stores a weight internally in pounds. 
Create functions setWeightPounds, setWeightKilograms, and setWeightOunces 
that take an input weight in the specified weight scale, convert the weight to pounds if required,
and store that weight in the class's member variable. 
Also, create functions that return the stored weight in pounds, kilograms, and ounce. 
Write a main funcion to test your class.
Use the equations shown next to convert between the weight scales.
    1 pound = 16 ounces
    1 kilogram = 2.21 pounds
